With Portainer running, it's now possible to access the dashboard and manage the cluster via a UI.

The dashboard is running on Port 9000 and can be accessed via [this link](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-9000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)

The first screen asks you to create a password for the **admin** user.

Once configured, the second screen will ask you to log in to the dashboard using the password defined.

The password will be required to login in future.
